Sorting algorithms & Big O
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

Format used for O notation
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n square -> O(n^2)
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
n + k -> O(n+k)

The "short" notation (don't use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n)

About the files
In each line will contain the following big O notation about time complexity in the best case, in the average case, in the worst case
